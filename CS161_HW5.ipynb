    "*Proof*\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) $\\implies$\n",
    "This follows from the definition of a source sheep. In order for sheep $b$ to repost sheep $a$ there must be a a directed path from sheep $a$ to $b$. Since a source sheep must be reposted by all other sheep it must have directed paths to all other sheep, including all other source sheep. (Also every sheep has a directed path to itself of length zero i.e. by posting it 'reposts' itself). \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) $\\impliedby$\n",
    "By contradiction. It will suffice to prove that a non-source sheep cannot have a directed path to any source sheep. Suppose a non-source sheep $a$ has a directed path to a souce sheep $s$. Since $s$ by definition must have a directed path to all other sheep and sheep $a$ has a directed path to $s$, sheep $a$ must in turn have a directed path to all other sheep via $s$. But that would make it a source sheep which is a contradiction proving that a non-source sheep cannot have a directed path to any source sheep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have shown that all source sheep must have directed paths to each other and no non-source sheep can have a directed path to any source sheep, we have shown that all source sheep are in a strongly connected component which contains no non-source sheep. "

Since a source sheep has directed paths to all other sheep if we run DFS(s) for any source sheep s at any point within the loop in DFS(G) we will visit all remaining unvisited nodes. So at the end of DFS(s), all nodes will have been marked black and there will be no further calls to DFS for any node. Any node u will have a larger finish time than all other nodes marked complete before u in the present call and earlier calls. DFS(v) will mark v complete last (after all other nodes visited during the call). Thus s will have a larger finish time than all other nodes visited during DFS(s) as well as those visited in earlier calls to DFS. As there will be no further calls to DFS, s will have the largest finish time out of all the nodes.\n",

    "If a source node exists then everything in (b) will apply so it will be the node returned by `find_source`. If it is the source node then running DFS starting from it i.e. `DFS(maybe_source, 1)` should lead to it having the largest finish time again since all nodes can be reached from it so the entire graph will have been completed by this one call meaning that `maybe_source` is in fact a source. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand if there is no source node in the graph, `maybe_source` will merely be the last node v for which DFS(v) is called in DFS(G) when this is called in `find_source`. So after reinitialising the graph and running DFS starting from `maybe_source`, the finish time of `maybe_source` will not equal `t_max` since all nodes will not be completed at this point. This allows us to deduce that `maybe_source` is not a source. Since we have shown that if a source exists then the node with the highest must a source, this means that no source exists.  \n",

Supposing nodes are prioritised in alphabetical order, the first DFS(P) will be called, which will find {Q, R}, then DFS(S) will be called which will find T.  So S will be returned by `find_source(G)` and we will have that `t_max = f[S] = 10`. However after calling DFS(S, 1), `f[S] = 4 != t_max`. "
